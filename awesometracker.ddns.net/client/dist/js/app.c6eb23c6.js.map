Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: Calle Salvadas 7 2A. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Company is located at the address in Section 10.8.

For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hard copy writing.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word \"including\" means \"including without limitation\". If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Your Privacy.</strong> Please read <a href=\"https://privacypolicytemplate.net/\">our Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><strong>Copyright/Trademark Information.</strong> Copyright ©.

id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>This document is intended for programmers who want to create applications that can interact with our data. Awesometracker and API basics are explained here. It also provides an overview of the different functions that the API supports performing for its users.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p id=\"api-version\">Currently API version <code>1.0</code>. | Last update 14/05/2020.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p id=\"api-doc\">API doc version <code>0.1</code> | Last update 14/05/2020.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h4 id=\"start\">Before start</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>You need a Awesometracker Account to access the Awesometracker web and register your app.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>To login into an existing account user the following link <a href=\"https://awesometracker.ddns.net/login\">https://awesometracker.ddns.net/login</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>To create an account access the following link to register in the system <a href=\"https://awesometracker.ddns.net/registry\">https://awesometracker.ddns.net/registry</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Once you have the account created you can register the new application or edit an existing one from the side menu in the apps section.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h4 id=\"recomendations\">Recomendations</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data format. JSON is a common, language-independent data format that provides a simple text representation of arbitrary data structures.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.json.org/json-en.html\">https://www.json.org/json-en.html</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3 id=\"resources\">Resources and resource types</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>A resource is an individual data entity with a unique identifier. The table below describes the different types of resources that you can interact with using the API.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<Table v-bind:type=\"'resources'\"/>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Note that, in many cases, a resource contains references to other resources.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Your application must have authorization credential to be able to use the Awesometracker API. It also explains how to find or create authorization credential for your project.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The authorization credential is a token that has to be provided in every request made to the API.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h4>Create an app and get the token</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Once the session started open apps page on the left side menu.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In case you have an app already created, it should appear, just click on it and go to the page of the app itself where you can see its data, including the token.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Otherwise, that is, in case you do not have any app created in the system, you must first create one by pressing the button with the cross and repeat the previous step.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Once you already have a valid token, you only have to make a request to our API indicating the token in the header of the request. To do this, just use the following key value pair: <code>{token: 'token'}</code>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>In some languages or libraries, this code may vary. To do so, check the documentation corresponding to the language or library that you use.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3 id=\"methods\">Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h4>Supported operations</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The following table shows the most common methods that the API supports.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Table v-bind:type=\"'operations'\"/>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The table below identifies the operations that are supported for different types of resources.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Table v-bind:type=\"'supported_operations'\"/>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3 id=\"request\">API requests</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h4 id=\"request-overview\">Overview</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>For clarity of presentation, the samples on this page show the distinctive elements of each request and abbreviate the base URL for the host that processes Data API requests (<code>https://awesometracker.ddns.net/api/v1</code>). To make the request outside of the context of the samples, you need to include the full URL.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>The following lists specifies the available routes as well as the optional and mandatory parameters required for their use.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>All content surrounded by {} refers to some type of request identifier. This reference can be of 2 mandatory type when it is represented as {testCode} or optional when it is accompanied by? like for example {testCode?}. The main objective of this parameter is to identify a specific resource from the entire list. By default and in all requests the parameter will be the code that identifies the resource. In some requests, this parameter will accept different values indicated in the request description itself.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<h4 id=\"request-get\">List</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/users/{code?}/</code>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This code can be user name, email or code.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/trackerLogs/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/applications/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/apps/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/posts/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/userCategories/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/appCategories/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/apiCalls/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<code>GET base-url/status/{code?}/</code>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Apart from the previous routes, the following routes allow you to obtain certain resources from certain users such as logs, apps or applications.
